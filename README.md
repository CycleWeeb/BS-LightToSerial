# BS-Lightoutput
A Beatsaber mod that allows you to output the lightning events as a serial signal to be used in a Arduino,ESP32 and more

This mod now includes a Arduino librarary with a example code.

You can set the comport number and the baudrate you want to use in the options menu of Beatsaber. (in my experience i could not exceed a baudraute of 115200. I used a ESP32 and it didnt received any data if it was over that value)
